<h2>Summary</h2>
Continuing my journey as a software developer, I was tasked with creating this To Do App.
I quickly jumped in and broke down each part in sudo code and then took the time to develop each part. 
I learned quite a few new concepts in Javascript and of course the problem-solving side which did leave me scratching my head a few times.
It was worth every minute I put my time into it.
